# python-api-challenge
Python API Challenge for Data Analytics Bootcamp .
Using Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer the question:
"What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

##Instructions
The activity has two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

In WeatherPy I used a Python script to visualize the weather of 500 cities with varying distances from the equator. I used citipy Python library (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy) and OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api) and provided starter code to general the random coordinates and nearest city to the provided latitude and longitude. 

I then created plots to show the relationship between the weather variables and Latitude by using OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data from the cities generated by the starter code.  

###Latitude vs. Temperature

###Latitude vs. Humidity

Next I computed the linear regression for each relationship by creating a fuction and separated the plots into Norther Hemispher vs. Southern Hemisphere. I then created a series of scatter plots that included the linear regression line and the r valvue.
